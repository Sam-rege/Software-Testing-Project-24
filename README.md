 End-to-End (E2E) QA Testing Approach

ðŸ§­ End-to-End QA Approach â€“ Manual & API Testing

This project follows a structured and practical **End-to-End QA testing approach** aligned with industry standards and real-world Agile processes.
 ðŸ”¹ 1. Requirement Analysis

* Reviewed PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria from BA/Product team.
* Identified testable features, user flows, and API endpoints.
* Clarified ambiguities through collaboration with devs and product owners.

 ðŸ”¹ 2. Test Planning

* Defined test strategy (Scope, Types of Testing, Test Environment).
* Identified key modules for **UI and API** validation.
* Created a **Test Plan document** covering timelines, resources, and risk areas.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Test Design

* Designed detailed **Test Scenarios and Test Cases** for:

  * Functional Testing
  * API Testing
  * Positive & Negative Scenarios
  * Edge Case Coverage
* Created **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** to map requirements to test cases.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Test Environment Setup

* Coordinated with dev/DevOps teams for stable test environment access.
* Configured Postman and Swagger for API testing.
* Ensured database access for test data verification (if applicable).
 ðŸ”¹ 5. Test Execution

* Performed:

  * **Smoke Testing** to validate basic functionalities.
  * **Functional & Regression Testing** on UI and APIs.
  * **Exploratory Testing** for critical flows and edge scenarios.
* Documented test results with screenshots and evidence.

 ðŸ”¹ 6. API Testing Approach

* Used **Postman** for:

  * Request/Response validation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  * Header/Body verification, parameter testing, and status code checks.
  * **Test scripts** for automated assertions in Postman.
* Validated APIs using **Swagger** for contract/schema verification.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Defect Reporting

* Logged defects with complete reproduction steps, severity/priority, and screenshots in **Jira**.
* Collaborated with devs for clarification, retesting, and closure.
ðŸ”¹ 8. Test Reporting

* Shared daily/weekly **test execution reports**.
* Created **Bug Summary** and **Test Summary Reports** post testing cycles.
* Provided clear **Go/No-Go recommendation** based on test results.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Final QA Sign-off

 Performed final regression cycle and verified all critical issues.
 Prepared QA sign-off document based on:

   Test coverage
   Defect trends
   Open issues (if any)
